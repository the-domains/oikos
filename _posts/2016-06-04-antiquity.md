  Within the body of Hawaiian architecture are various subsets of styles; each
  are considered typical of particular historical periods. The earliest form of
  Hawaiian architecture originates from what is called ancient Hawaiʻi—designs
  employed in the construction of village shelters from the simple shacks of
  outcasts and slaves, huts for the fishermen and canoe builders along the
  beachfronts, the shelters of the working class makaʻainana, the elaborate and
  sacred heiau of kahuna and the palatial thatched homes on raised basalt
  foundation of the aliʻi. The way a simple grass shack was constructed in
  ancient Hawaiʻi was telling of who lived in a particular home. The patterns in
  which dried plants and lumber were fashioned together could identify caste,
  skill and trade, profession and wealth. Hawaiian architecture previous to the
  arrival of British explorer Captain James Cook used symbolism to identify
  religious value of the inhabitants of certain structures. Feather standards
  called kahili and koa adorned with kapa cloth and crossed at the entrance of
  certain homes called puloʻuloʻu indicated places of aliʻi (nobility caste).
  Kiʻi enclosed within basalt walls indicated the homes of kahuna (priestly
  caste).
